# Superpoint Transformer
This folder contains the simplified version of the [Superpoint Transformer (SPT) library](https://github.com/drprojects/superpoint_transformer). It is adapted to work with our work on **Training-Free Hierarchical Scene Understanding for Gaussian Splatting with Superpoint Graphs**.

This library is used to partition the Gaussian Centroids Adjacency Graph into superpoints, and provides the data structure for the superpoint graph.
